The following CSS code snippet exhibits an unusual issue.  The `background-image` property doesn't apply correctly when the `background-size` is set to `cover` and the container element has a specific height.  Instead of covering the entire container maintaining aspect ratio, the image is often clipped or displays incorrectly. 
```css
div {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background-image: url('https://via.placeholder.com/800x600');
  background-size: cover;
}
```
